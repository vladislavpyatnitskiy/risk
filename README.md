# Risk Analysis with Python

Welcome to the Risk repository! This collection of Python scripts and techniques is tailored for financial professionals, risk analysts, and enthusiasts seeking powerful tools for assessing and managing financial risks. Leverage the capabilities of Python to enhance your risk management strategies with a focus on key techniques such as:

• Value-at-Risk (VaR): Gauge the potential loss under normal market conditions at a specified confidence level using both historical and parametric methods.

• Expected Shortfall (ES): Go beyond VaR by estimating the average loss in the tail of the distribution, providing a more comprehensive measure of risk.
